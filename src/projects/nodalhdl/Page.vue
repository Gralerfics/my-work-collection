                The most intuitive validation cases are the fragment-shader examples. Fragment shaders are naturally suited for computationally accelerated architecture design tasks; they output color values in parallel from input pixel coordinates.

                The following three examples are images captured during actual operation on an FPGA. These HDLs were generated directly from Python code using <code>nodalhdl</code> and automatically pipelined. In short, these images are outputed by real hardware circuits through HDMI cable.

            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                What I wanted here was not just another front end that prints HDL. The point was to build a workable middle layer for digital circuits, so that the circuit remains explicit and editable before code generation. That makes it possible to do structured reuse, automatic completion, timing analysis, and pipeline redistribution in one consistent flow.
            </p>
            <p>
                I divide the toolchain into three abstraction levels: a behavioral layer, a structural representation layer, and the HDL file model layer. The structural layer is the center. Upward, it can be built from Python-side behavior descriptions; downward, it maps to HDL files. Inside the toolchain, it is the layer where most transformations happen.
            </p>

            <h2>The structural representation</h2>
            <p>
                The core object is <code>Structure</code>, which corresponds to a module template. Inside it, ports, substructures, nodes, nets, and structured port bundles are all explicit objects. A structure can be instantiated into another structure, so hierarchy is represented directly instead of being flattened away from the beginning.
            </p>
            <p>
                We divide the circuit into basic elements such as Structure, Node, and Net, which reference each other, as shown in the diagram below:

            </figure>
            <p>
                This part matters because I wanted the representation to stay close to circuit block diagrams. The project uses substructures, ports, and nets to build signal paths, and a proxy interface makes substructure ports accessible through <code>IO</code> in a way that is much easier to work with than raw hierarchical references.

            <h2>Type system, deduction and runtime information</h2>
            <p>
                To make parameterized design practical, the project includes a custom type system instead of relying only on plain bit vectors. It supports arbitrary-width integers, fixed-point numbers, floating-point numbers, bundles, and IO wrappers. One important point is that some type information can be left incomplete and then deduced later.
            </p>
            <p>
                I keep that deduction-related information as runtime information attached to a structure instance rather than rewriting the original structure definition directly. That is what lets the same structure be safely reused in different places, while still allowing operations such as automatic type deduction, timing analysis, and later solidification of inferred information.
            </p>
            <p>
                To isolate runtime information between different instances and prevent runtime information of structures that are instantiated multiple times from being confused, I use Runtime ID as a unique identifier that can be uniquely derived from the Runtime ID of the upper-level structure.

            <h2>Workflow, STA, and automatic pipelining</h2>
            <p>
                The repository exposes a fairly complete structural workflow: duplication and stripping, singletonization, substructure expansion, automatic type deduction, HDL generation, persistence, and static timing analysis. In the examples this usually appears as a sequence such as <code>singletonize()</code>, <code>expand()</code>, <code>deduction()</code>, <code>VivadoSTA.analyse()</code>, <code>pipelining()</code>, and finally <code>generation()</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The automatic pipelining part is based on retiming. The implementation provides both a simple circuit model and an extended circuit model. The simple one is faster and works well for quick verification; the extended one models internal paths more carefully and can produce slightly better results. In both cases, the idea is not to blindly insert registers, but to add pipeline stages and then redistribute them through retiming so the final register layout is better balanced.
            </p>
            <p>
                Static timing analysis (STA) is a prerequisite for automated pipelined timing information. I used Vivado's STA functionality to parse its ASCII-formatted reports to obtain timing information. To obtain timing information for each component, I needed to perform STA for each component individually, choosing multi-threading for synchronous execution to speed things up. To reduce the time consumption of this step, I implemented a caching system, allowing unmodified components to directly reuse previous STA results without needing to rerun.

            <h2>Behavioral generation and the shader example</h2>
            <p>
                On top of the structural layer, I also tried to introduce some HLS-like behavior. The basic idea is to use Python execution itself to trace signal flow and build a computational graph, then turn that graph into structural objects. This part is mainly aimed at combinational datapaths; sequential logic and FSM generation are discussed, but not yet complete.

                To illustrate further, as shown in Demo 2 above, its core circuitry was generated by executing the following Python code, and the VHDL it generates has tens of thousands of lines.

            <h2>Discussion</h2>
            <p>
                The project is still incomplete in several obvious places. The structural layer is expressive, but that also makes persistence and some integrations less lightweight. Timing analysis is currently tied mainly to Vivado. Sequential logic generation, generic simulation on the structure layer, richer board-support components, and more complete visual tooling are still future work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even so, the main path I wanted is already usable: describe arithmetic-heavy behavior in Python, turn it into an explicit structure, run deduction and timing-driven pipelining on that structure, and emit HDL that can be pushed into a real FPGA validation flow.
