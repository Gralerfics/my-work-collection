        <strong>Key points.</strong> First, this project implements a usable application runtime on a
        small STM32 watch instead of stopping at fixed-function firmware. Second, the runtime is tied
        to actual board resources: USB mass storage, EEPROM-backed files, LVGL widgets, IMU,
        microphone, RTC, charging detection, and vibration.
      </p>
      <p class="detail-text">
        <strong>Stack.</strong> STM32F405RGT6, FreeRTOS, LVGL, USB FS MSC, FatFs, board-level
        drivers, and PikaScript with custom Python-facing libraries. The work covers board revision,
        firmware structure, runtime conventions, and script examples.

      <h2>Runtime model</h2>
      <p>
        The core design choice was to make user scripts deployable as files rather than building every
        function into the firmware image. The README documents the mechanism clearly: the watch mounts
        as a USB mass-storage device, scripts are copied into the root directory, and the firmware
        scans them into an application list. Each script begins with a small metadata header that
        declares icon, name, and color. That header is not decoration; it is the contract between the
        filesystem and the launcher UI.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means the boundary of the project is not "watch firmware plus some demos". It is closer
        to a small embedded runtime with a launcher, a file format convention, a script interpreter,
        and a wrapped device API.

      <h2>Scheduling and script constraints</h2>
      <p>
        The most practical detail in the documentation is the scheduling rule. Script code is expected
        to yield by calling <code>zws.System.delayMs()</code>, which is backed by FreeRTOS
        <code>osDelay</code>. Without that yield point, UI refresh, touch handling, brightness sync,
        and other system tasks stall. This is a good example of the project being honest about its
        execution model: the scripting layer is intentionally lightweight, but it is still running in
        a cooperative environment on top of a real RTOS.
      </p>
      <p>
        That constraint also explains the rest of the API design. The runtime is not trying to emulate
        desktop Python. It exposes only the parts of the system that can be made predictable on a
        small embedded target.
      </p>

      <h2>Python-facing API surface</h2>
      <p>
        The API document is rough, but it is enough to reconstruct the intended software boundary.
        The standard library wrapper provides timing, display brightness, RTC access, and
        <code>Display.getField()</code> for acquiring the root object of the current app screen. The
        peripheral wrapper exposes IMU, battery, microphone, and vibrator. On the GUI side, scripts
        work directly with wrapped LVGL types and callbacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>Display.getField()</code> is a useful detail. The documentation explicitly discourages
        building top-level UI objects directly on the raw active screen, because transient system UI
        such as pull-down panels can make objects appear in the wrong place. A dedicated application
        root object avoids that. That is a small implementation detail, but it shows the project is
        solving integration problems at the platform boundary instead of only exposing raw library
        calls.
      </p>
      <p>
        The calculator example makes the model concrete: create LVGL objects on the app field, assign
        IDs to buttons, register <code>lv.EVENT.CLICKED</code> callbacks, and keep the main loop alive
        with RTOS-backed delays. The scripting layer is therefore not just sensor readouts; it is able
        to build interactive UI and event-driven behaviour on top of the firmware.
      </p>

      <h2>What the example scripts actually cover</h2>
      <p>
        The sample scripts are valuable because they exercise different subsystems rather than just
        repeating the same pattern. The repository includes:
      </p>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>UI and callback handling in the calculator example.</li>
        <li>Microphone sampling and FFT-based spectrum display in the frequency example.</li>
        <li>RTC interaction and settings UI.</li>
        <li>Brightness, temperature, charging, and battery-related tests.</li>
        <li>IMU-based small physics sketches using acceleration input.</li>
        <li>Vibration and image-resource access in lightweight application demos.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The frequency example is particularly representative. It combines microphone sampling,
        windowing, real FFT, magnitude calculation, and LVGL slider updates in a loop that still yields
        to the scheduler. That is enough to show the runtime can support sensor processing, display
        output, and repeated UI updates without falling apart.

      <h2>Firmware and hardware were developed together</h2>
      <p>
        The repository structure and README both show that the project was not written against a fixed
        off-the-shelf board. Hardware revisions were part of the work. The README lists several board
        versions, ending in a stacked version 3.0 design, and explicitly notes that earlier revisions
        were partly transitional and still contained issues to be fixed. That progression matters
        because the firmware assumptions depend on the final board composition: display, touch,
        STM32F405, power path, IMU, microphone, vibration motor, and USB-C are all part of the same
        design target.

        <figcaption>Later PCB revision from the repository, showing the board was iterated during development.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The board render is also worth keeping because it makes the packaging problem visible. This is
        not firmware developed in isolation; the software platform was being built for a compact
        wearable form factor with a constrained board area and a nontrivial peripheral set.

      <h2>What is technically strongest here</h2>
      <p>
        The strongest part of ZeptoWatch is the interface between firmware internals and user code. A
        lot of embedded projects can demonstrate a display, a sensor, or an interpreter in isolation.
        This one goes further and defines a working combination: file-based deployment, launcher
        metadata, wrapped board APIs, LVGL bindings, and explicit RTOS-aware scripting conventions.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is also where most of the technical risk sits. If any one of those pieces had been left
        undefined, the project would have collapsed back into a collection of demos. Instead, the repo
        shows a credible attempt to make the device extensible at runtime while still keeping the
        system small enough to run on an STM32F405-based watch.
