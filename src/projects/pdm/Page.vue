            <h2>System setup</h2>
            <p>
                The task itself is simple to describe: the robot starts in a cluttered indoor scene, navigates to a door, aligns the manipulator with the handle, and opens the door without breaking the non-holonomic constraint of the base. What made the project interesting was that the whole pipeline had to be built as one system rather than as disconnected demos.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the final setup, the global planner produced a collision-free reference path in the map, the local controller tracked that path under Ackermann kinematics, and a separate predictive controller was used when the task changed from navigation to manipulation. That separation let us benchmark the local planner properly, while still keeping a full demonstration that actually completed the task.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was a group project, not a solo build. According to the division recorded in the report, I was mainly responsible for the simulation environment, the MPC / MPPI controllers, the door-opening part of the system, and part of the experiments, analysis, and report writing. The global planners were mainly developed by the other group members.

            <h2>Global planning</h2>
            <p>
                The project uses a hierarchical structure, so the global planner is not responsible for exact tracking. Its role is to give the base a feasible route through the clutter and to hand a local reference segment to the controller. In the report and codebase, we benchmarked several RRT-family planners, including informed variants, but the important point here is the interface: the local controller always works on a short reference path instead of a single point target.
            </p>
            <p>
                That design made the local controller easier to tune. It also made failure modes much easier to read. If the robot drifted or oscillated, I could inspect whether the issue came from the short-horizon predictive model or from the reference path itself, instead of debugging the whole stack as one opaque planner.

            <h2>Predictive local control</h2>
            <p>
                For navigation, I implemented both MPC and MPPI on the same Ackermann state model. The state is the base pose <code>[x, y, theta]</code>, and the control is <code>[v, delta]</code>. In the report, the chassis dynamics are written in continuous form as the bicycle model:
            </p>
            <ProjectEquation
                :code="ackermannEquation"
                :framed="false"
                caption="Ackermann chassis model used throughout the planning and control stack."
            />
            <p>
                For local path tracking, the report defines a shared finite-horizon objective and uses it as the common benchmark target for both MPC and MPPI. The cost includes path-tracking error, control effort, a soft collision penalty, and a terminal term:
            </p>
            <ProjectEquation
                :code="pathCostEquation"
                :framed="false"
                caption="Path-tracking objective in the report."
            />
            <p>
                The benchmark metric reported later is the RMSE-ATE between the reference trajectory and the actual tracked trajectory. This is the quantity used in the report tables and scatter plot when comparing controller settings:
            </p>
            <ProjectEquation
                :code="mppiEquation"
                :framed="false"
                caption="RMSE-ATE definition used in the local-planner benchmark."
            />
            <p>
                The point of implementing both controllers was not to claim that one dominates the other everywhere. The benchmark instead made the trade-off visible. MPC gave cleaner tracking when the horizon was short and the environment was not too adversarial, but the solve time rose quickly with horizon length. MPPI was much cheaper per step and much easier to keep stable at high success rate once the horizon was long enough, but it was more sensitive to rollout count and produced rougher tracking in some settings.
            </p>
            <figure class="project-media project-media--large">
                <img :src="localBenchmarkSummary" alt="Benchmark summary comparing MPC and MPPI on local path tracking" />
                <figcaption>
                    Local-controller benchmark. MPC improves from 40% to 80% success as the horizon grows from 10 to 20, while MPPI reaches 90% success at horizon 20 with much lower per-step compute cost.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                The benchmark values in <code>summary.csv</code> are the numbers I actually used when deciding which configuration to keep in the demonstrations. MPC with <code>H=20</code> reached <code>0.8</code> success rate, but the mean computation time was already around <code>127.5 ms</code>. MPPI with <code>H=20, K=200</code> reached <code>0.9</code> success at around <code>5.2 ms</code>, and even <code>K=900</code> stayed around <code>20.5 ms</code>. The tracking RMSE was not always better for MPPI, but the compute / robustness trade-off was much more attractive for the full task.

            <h2>Door opening</h2>
            <p>
                The door-opening stage is where the project stops being a plain navigation assignment. Once the base reaches the interaction area, the problem changes to whole-body predictive control: the arm has to reach the handle with the right orientation, while the base still has to move so that the arm does not over-stretch or enter an awkward configuration.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the report, this stage is written as a unified predictive controller over the coupled chassis-arm state. The objective penalizes end-effector position error, end-effector orientation error through
                <ProjectEquation :code="toAngleInlineEquation" inline />
                , control effort, and an additional XY penalty that discourages the end effector from entering the projected chassis footprint.
            </p>
            <ProjectEquation
                :code="doorEquation"
                :framed="false"
                caption="Unified predictive-control objective for the door-opening task."
            />
            <p>
                This stage is also where the non-holonomic constraint actually matters. If the controller only solves the arm pose, it is easy to drive the manipulator into an unreachable or badly conditioned posture. The predictive formulation instead lets the chassis and arm compensate for each other over the horizon, which is why the full demonstration can keep the grasp and continue the opening motion instead of stopping at first contact.

            <h2>Results and takeaways</h2>
            <p>
                What I like about this project is that the report figures are backed by code that can still be inspected end to end. The same repository contains the local-planner model, the MPPI implementation, the benchmark scripts, and the full demonstration scripts. That makes the result much more useful than a one-off course demo, because I can go back to any layer and see why a particular behavior happened.
            </p>
            <p>
                The final result is not a polished robotics framework, but it is a complete working stack: a simulation environment, hand-written planners, predictive controllers, benchmarks, and a door-opening demonstration that ties them together. For me, that combination of controller implementation, experiment design, and system integration was the main value of the project.
